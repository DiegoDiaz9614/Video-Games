                        In a world broken by death and decay, Ellie is plunged into a whirlwind of grief and rage when the man who saved her—who became her protector, her family—is violently taken from her. Consumed by an insatiable thirst for vengeance, she sets off on a ruthless mission to hunt down those responsible.
                        With each step, Ellie plunges deeper into darkness, her heart heavy with the weight of loss and fury. Every life she takes brings fleeting satisfaction, but the void inside her only widens. She sacrifices friendships, her own sense of humanity, and ultimately, her peace of mind, all in the name of retribution.
                        As Ellie draws closer to her target, the line between justice and vengeance blurs, and she begins to realize that the pain she’s chasing can never truly be erased. In the end, she faces a devastating truth—revenge is a path that leads nowhere but further into emptiness. The bitter consequences of her choices threaten to consume her, leaving her with nothing but the wreckage of what she's lost.
                        In the face of the final confrontation, Ellie is left with a choice: to continue the cycle of violence or to walk away, burdened with the painful knowledge that the price of vengeance is always too high. As the dust settles, she is left alone, haunted by what she's become and what she's lost. The quest for vengeance has cost her everything—yet in the silence, there is no peace.

                    At the start of The Last of Us, Joel sees Ellie as just a job—a girl to protect until he can pass her off to the Fireflies. But as they journey through a world ravaged by infection, filled with dangers both human and monstrous, their bond grows. Ellie becomes more than just a burden to Joel—she becomes someone he can’t imagine losing.
                    Their mission is to deliver Ellie to the Fireflies, who believe her immunity could be the key to a cure. But when they finally reach them, Joel learns that creating a cure would cost Ellie’s life. Faced with this impossible truth, Joel is forced to make a choice that will change everything.
                    After discovering that finding a cure would mean sacrificing Ellie, what will Joel do? The answer lies in the choices he makes next, and the devastating consequences of those decisions.
